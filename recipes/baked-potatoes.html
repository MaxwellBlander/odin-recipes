    <h3 class="yellowtxt font2">Description</h3>
    <p class="redtxt font outline">Russet potatoes are the best for baking due to their thick skins that cook <em>cripsy</em>. They are a classic staple that has many benefits from providing energy to aiding in muscle recovery. As potatoes are grown with high amounts of pesticide, I would reccomend buying organic potatoes.</p>

    <ol class="redtxt olfont list-margin">
        <li>Rub potatoes clean of dirt under running water.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut out the root eye like nodules</strong> from the potatoe to reduce solanine intake as well as the stem connection at the tip of the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Stab a hole through each potatoe with a knife or poke some holes with a fork to ensure they dont burst in the oven</li>
        <li>Oil up the potatoes in your choice of coconut oil or olive oil</li>

        <li>Allow the potatoes to sit in the oven for <span class="highlight">45-55 minutes at 450 fahrenheit</span> and do not cover them. There is also no need to flip them</li>
        <li>Remove the potatoes from the oven and spice them with onion powder. <strong>Use caution</strong> for they will be <em>hot!</em></li>
