    <h3 class="yellowtxt font2">Description</h3>
    <p class="redtxt font outline">Russet potatoes are the best for baking due to their thick skins that cook cripsy. They are a classic staple that has many benefits from providing energy to aiding in muscle recovery. As potatoes are grown with high amounts of pesticide I would reccomend buying organic potatoes.</p>
