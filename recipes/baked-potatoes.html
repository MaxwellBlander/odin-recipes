    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Russet potatoes are the best for baking due to their thick skins that cook cripsy. They are a classic staple that has many benefits from providing energy to aiding in muscle recovery. As potatoes are grown with high pesticides I would reccomend buying organic potatoes.</p>
